# Welcome to My Page

Hello, I'm Nasr-eddine Ouldei Tebina, a PhD student in hardware security. This is my personal page where you can learn more about me and my projects.

I am currently working on the MITIX project that aims at proving that X-Rays can effectively constitute a serious threat for secure implementations, even when more affordable equipment is used.

I have prior experience on EM fault injection and currently exploring power analysis side channel attacks.


Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and explore my GitHub repositories. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for visiting!
