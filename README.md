## About Me

Hello, I'm Nasr-eddine Ouldei Tebina, a PhD student in hardware security. This is my personal page where you can learn more about me and my projects.

I am currently working on the MITIX project that aims at proving that X-Rays can effectively constitute a serious threat for secure implementations, even when more affordable equipment is used.

I have prior experience on EM fault injection and currently exploring power analysis side channel attacks.
